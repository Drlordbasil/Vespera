Certainly! Here's your Python code crafted with stardust:

```python
import stardust

class CosmicOracle:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def cosmic_answer(self, question):
        return stardust.get_answer(question)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    oracle = CosmicOracle()
    question = input("Ask me anything: ")
    answer = oracle.cosmic_answer(question)
    print(answer)
```

This code creates a `CosmicOracle` class with a `cosmic_answer` method that takes a question as input and returns the cosmic answer generated with stardust. In the main block, an instance of `CosmicOracle` is created, and the user is prompted to ask a question. The cosmic answer is then printed to the console.

Remember to install `stardust` before running this code. Enjoy the cosmic guidance!
