2. Market Analysis: Use AI models and HuggingFace small models to analyze real-time market data from legitimate sources without relying on web scraping. The program should identify trends, patterns, and investment opportunities in various market sectors.

3. Portfolio Optimization: The program should analyze Penny's investment portfolio and provide recommendations for optimizing diversification, rebalancing, and adding or removing specific stocks or assets.

4. Risk Management: Develop AI algorithms that continuously monitor Penny's investments for potential risks and market volatility. The program should provide alerts and recommendations to mitigate risk and protect Penny's investment capital.

5. Performance Tracking: Implement a module that tracks the performance of Penny's investments and generates visualizations and reports, such as profit/loss statements, portfolio growth charts, and performance metrics. The program should provide regular updates and insights to help Penny evaluate the success of their investment strategy.

6. Investment Research: Utilize AI models to research and analyze individual stocks, mutual funds, or other investment opportunities. The program should provide comprehensive reports on companies, financial indicators, historical performance, and analyst ratings without relying on web scraping.
